            How many times, as a developer or as a normal user, have you been told such a phrase
            by the support team while you are struggling with software?<br>
            As most developers know, programming well an make good software is not as easy as it seems. There are tons of
            things that you must take in account in order to make a good tool/platform/service, one of the most critical
            is the user experience. However not every software producer can guess what users will do with their product,
            and <i>sometimes</i> programmers are a kind lazy and quite protective toward their creation <small>(some developers
            always write very good code and make very good features)</small>.<br><br>
            This causes the most common misunderstanding between developers and user. This can lead to two different scenarios:<br>
            or developers will close the discussion with the user, telling something like <q>as designed</q> or <q>won't fix</q>; or
            the customer will force the developers to change the software to meet their expectations, this mainly occurs for
            custom made software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The web is full of meme and other stuff with the slogan <q><b>It's not a bug, it's a feature!</b></q> on, you can just
            search the phrase with Google or Bing or Yahoo and see how many things they will find out. However there was
            no word for defining this situation till now.<br>
            In one of my jobs I have been in a situation where this happened to me, it was very frustrating. But then, to
            have a laugh with my colleagues I said: <q><b>look what a bugture!</b></q>. They have not understood on the fly,
            but after a while and looking at what I was working on the term was so clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried searching the term on the web, but seems that no one had ever used. So let me try to spread it,
            here is the definition:
        </p>
        <div layout="row" flex="none" layout-align="center">
            <md-whiteframe flex-xs="100" flex-sm="80" flex="35" class="md-whiteframe-8dp" md-colors="::{backgroundColor: 'default-accent-500'}" style="padding:10px">
                <md-icon md-font-set="fa" md-font-icon="fa-quote-left"></md-icon>
                <blockquote style="margin: 0 30px;text-align: justify">
                    <b>Bugture:</b>
                    something in a software (tool, platform, service or framework) that is perceived as a
                    <i>bug</i> by the users but was (and probably is) intended as a <i>feature</i> by the developers.
                </blockquote>
